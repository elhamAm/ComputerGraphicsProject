	<h1>Motivation</h1>
	<p>
		This image inspired us because of the perfect aiming time of the arrow towards the deer. We can also sense the motion because the image is tilted.
	</p>	
	<p>
		We also find this scenario interesting because we would have a lot of potential for implementing different visual effects. For instance we will be able to render the fog in the background
		using homogeneous participating media and we have a lot of different surfaces to which we can apply images as textures. However, we do plan on simplifying the characters
		to some extent since simulating the hair and skin of the human would be rather difficult. We also plan on modifying our image by for example adding some water on the ground or having the 
		arrow soar in the air. In addition, we plan to adjust the aperture and apply camera motion blur to strengh motion effects in our scene, and use denosing technique to reduce the render time.
	</p>
	<p>
		It is however possible that we will not be able to render all of our features on this particular image in order not to hurt the scene. We will render the remaining features on other example 
		features. For validation, we will compare the our renderer's results for specific features with the results of a renderer such as Mitsuba.

	<h1>Our breakdown of points</h1>
	<p> Elham: 15 + 15 + 10 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5</p>
	<p> Zheyu: 30 + 15 + 5 + 5 + 5</p>


<!-- ================================================================= -->

		<h2>Zheyu features</h2>

		<h3>30 points</h3>
		<h4>Advanced Denoising</h4>
		<p>
			I will first perform validations on some simple scenes (e.g. Cornell box scene) then apply denoising to our scene to see the effect.
		</p>

		<h3>15 points</h3>
		<h4>Advanced Camera Model</h4>
		<p>
			The three effects I choose is depth of field, non-sepherical aperture and chromatic aberrations. I will validate them on our inspirational image. 
		</p>

		<h3>5 points</h3>
		<h4>Images as Textures</h4>
		<p>
			I will add textures to the deer and the character.
		</p>

		<h4>Motion Blur for Cameras</h4>
		<p>
			I will make the camera move in the same direction as the arrow in our scene. 
		</p>

		<h4>Normal Mapping</h4>
		<p>
			I will add normal maps to ground and walls and possibly the character in our scene.
		</p>
		<br>
		<br>

<!-- ================================================================= -->

		<h2>Elham features</h2>

		<h3>15 points</h3>
		<h4>Homogeneous Participating Media</h4>
		<p>
			I will use this for rendering the fog in the background.
		</p>

		<h4>Environment Map Emitter</h4> 
		<p>
			I will use this on other images. 
		</p>

		<h3>10 points</h3>
		<h4>Object Motion Blur</h4>
		<p>
			This will be validated on separate images but we will possibly move the arrow of the aimer to the air and apply motion blur on it.
		</p>

		<h3>5 points</h3>
		<h4>Euler rendering</h4>
		<p>
			I will be using Euler to render our images and tweak nori to be able to use the euler for the rendering.
		</p>

		<h4>Simple Extra Emitters :spotlight or directional light</h4>
		<p>
			I will try to render a  spotlight emitter on example images and perhaps on the main image aas well.
		</p>
		<h4>Simple Extra BSDF :rough dielectric </h4>
		<p>
			I will try to do this bsdf for the human(if we transform it into a robot) or on added objects on the ground and also on additional example images.
		</p>
		
		<h4>Modeling meshes</h4>
		<p>
			I will either model the deer or the aimer in blender.
		</p>
